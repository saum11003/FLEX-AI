# FlexAI: AI Fitness Trainer
# Real-Time Fitness Pose Estimation

This project leverages Google's MediaPipe framework to develop a real-time fitness application that uses pose estimation to help users improve their exercise form and efficiency. Our application specifically focuses on calculating angles between body joints to provide instant feedback during workouts, ensuring exercises such as squats, push ups, shoulder presses and lunges are performed correctly.

## Features

- **Real-Time Pose Estimation**: Utilizes MediaPipe's BlazePose for detecting 33 body landmarks with high precision.
- **Angle Calculation**: Employs trigonometric methods to calculate the angles between joints like hips, knees, and ankles.
- **Dynamic Feedback System**: Provides users with real-time feedback on their exercise form to minimize the risk of injury and maximize the effectiveness of their workout.
